djxmRoundRectList4/xp\:panel[1]/xp\:paragraph[3]/text()=[ja| A server-side onAfterTransitionOut event is currently\n          on this page, Page 1. This gets fired after the end of\n          the transition on to Page 2 ]

djxmRoundRectList1/xp\:paragraph[5]/text()=[ja| For example, if you had an animation that runs while\n        a page is displayed, you might start that animation when the page is\n        shown, and stop the animation when the page is hidden, so that it is\n        no longer consuming resources that might make the other pages run\n        slowly. ]
djxmRoundRectList1/xp\:paragraph[3]/text()=[ja| These events then occur in this order\: page1\n        onAfterTransitionOut, page2 onAfterTransitionIn. ]
djxmRoundRectList1/xp\:paragraph[1]/text()=[ja| These events are those that occurs when transitioning between mobile Application Page\n        controls. ]

djxmRoundRectList4/xp\:panel[1]/xp\:paragraph[2]/text()=[ja| Server-side events to be fired one per page ]
djxmRoundRectList1/xp\:paragraph[4]/text()=[ja| The transition in events can be used for preparing\n        some content in the page that is becoming displayed, and the\n        transition out events might be used for cleaning up some content\n        that is no longer needed since the page is no longer displayed. ]
djxmRoundRectList1/xp\:paragraph[2]/text()=[ja| The sequence of transition events are triggered in a\n        defined order. For example, say you have two Application Page\n        controls, page1 and page2, where page1 is currently shown. When you\n        click on a button that causes a transition to page2, these events\n        are first triggered in this order\: page1 onBeforeTransitionOut,\n        page2 onBeforeTransitionIn - then page2 is made visible. ]
djxmRoundRectList6/xp\:paragraph[1]/text()=[ja| A server-side onAfterTransitionIn event is currently on\n        this page, Page 3. This gets fired after the transition\n        from Page 2 and into Page 3 ]
